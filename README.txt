Deathroll is a gambling game from the well known mmo rpg : World Of Warcraft
The game is the WoW equivalent of playing dice
The rules of the game: 
    - Play against just one other person, and the first person rolls times 10 the amount of gold that he wants to bet
    - The other person rolls from the number that person 1 got and the first person rolls again from the number this guy got
    - This go on until one of them reaches 1
    - The first to roll 1 loses

This app will be operated by writing "'/roll " + the number that you want to bet times 10 (ex: "/roll 100")
If you do not write it like this, it will be considered as an invalid input
You start up with 10 gold each time you play a game
When you have no gold, you lose
You do not have a condition to win the game, just go on and gamble

Have fun and good luck :
